# Default Pose Assignment
#
# Normally, the default pose to play will be the first in the sitter's menu.
# However, you can specify a different pose or sync as the default for male/female
# shaped avatars by adding an "M" or "F" after the animation file name. e.g:

POSE SitF|Sit1|M
POSE SitM|Sit2|F

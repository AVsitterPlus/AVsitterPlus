# Auto-assign seats by gender
#
# You can designate a [SITTER](/avsitterplus_avpos.html#sitter) for male/female
# shaped avatars by adding an "M" or "F" after the sitter name.
# When an avatar sits, they will be assigned to the first unoccupied sitter
# that matches the gender of their shape, if available. e.g:

SITTER 0|Female seat|F
SITTER 1|Male seat|M

# If the seat is not gender specific, then don't assign a gender. e.g:
SITTER 2|Friend seat

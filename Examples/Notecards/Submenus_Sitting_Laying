## "Built-In" animation sequence

You can play animations in a series simply by adding extra animations to the [POSE](/avsitterplus_avpos.html#pose) (or [SYNC](/avsitterplus_avpos.html#sync)) commands. The animations all share the same position/rotation in the notecard, therefore they *must* be designed to be played together. This can be a continuous scene OR simply regular looped animations that were made as a sequence compatible set (all using use the same position/rotation).

The format for the notecard is as follows:

    POSE <menu_name>|<animation>|<duration>|<animation>|<duration>|<animation>|<duration> ...

or

    SYNC <menu_name>|<animation>|<duration>|<animation>|<duration>|<animation>|<duration> ...

e.g.

    POSE Solo-SEQ|anim1|30|anim2|30|anim3|30

When "Solo-SEQ" is selected, the animations will cycle between anim1, anim2 and anim3, playing each for 30 seconds.

Usually a sequence will loop, but if a dash ( - ) is entered instead of a duration then the sequence will stop after playing. e.g.

    POSE Solo-SEQ|anim1|30|anim2|-

## Auto-assign by gender
Determining the gender of an avatar's shape is [now possible](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/OBJECT_BODY_SHAPE_TYPE), and can be used for automatic sitter and default pose assignment in AVsitterPlus. The gender of an avatar's shape can be set from the Appearance Editor in the SL viewer.

### SITTER assignment
You can designate a [SITTER](/avsitterplus_avpos.html#sitter) for male/female shaped avatars by adding an "M" or "F" after the sitter name. When an avatar sits, they will be assigned to the first unoccupied sitter that matches the gender of their shape, if available. e.g:

```
SITTER 0|Female seat|F
...

SITTER 1|Male seat|M
...
```

If the seat is not gender specific, then don't assign a gender. e.g:

```
SITTER 2|Friend seat
...
```

{% include important.html content="SITTER assignment will not work in cases where there are [SET](/avsitterplus_sittargets.html) defined. Support for this may be added in future." %}

### Pose assignment
Normally, the default pose to play will be the first in the sitter's menu. However, you can specify a different [POSE](/avsitterplus_avpos.html#pose) or [SYNC](/avsitterplus_avpos.html#sync) as the default for male/female shaped avatars by adding an "M" or "F" after the animation file name. e.g:

```
POSE SitF|Sit1|M
POSE SitM|Sit2|F
```

## Variable speed animations

You can include animations of variable speed by naming them with + or - at the end of the file name and including them in the furniture. These files will be used in place of the default when the speed setting is changed by use of << Softer & Harder >> buttons.

e.g. if you have a POSE/SYNC as follows:

    SYNC Walking|Walk01

Then you can optionally include the animation files Walk01- (slower version) & Walk01+ (faster version) in addition to the Walk01 animation. Note, there should be no space between the animation name and the +/-.

The << Softer & Harder >> buttons will only be shown in a submenu if &#124;V is added to the MENU line. e.g.

    MENU Workout|V

Pressing the << Softer & Harder >> buttons will change the speed to the slower/faster animations. The speed will remain set until changed or until all avatars stand up from the furniture.


## Extra notecard commands
Some additional notecard commands exist _([read here for more information](avsitterplus_SpecialCommands_AVpos.html))_:

- [HELPER](/avsitterplus_SpecialCommands_AVpos.html#helper) - use the AVsitter1 style helper system, where you sit on the helper sticks.
- [KFM](/avsitterplus_SpecialCommands_AVpos.html#kfm) - if the object uses [llSetKeyframedMotion()](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlSetKeyframedMotion).
- [LROT](/avsitterplus_SpecialCommands_AVpos.html#lrot) - positioning buttons to work relative to the local rotation of the root prim, instead of global co-ordinates.
- [WARN](/avsitterplus_SpecialCommands_AVpos.html#warn) - disable the warning when there aren't enough prims for all sitters or checks for prop permissions.
- DFLT 0 - don't revert to the default pose when all avatars stand (unless the last pose was a SYNC pose).
- NOWIPE - tells the scripts not to wipe sittargets in other prims (use only if you have a good reason as you may end up with prims that have unnecessary SitTargets).

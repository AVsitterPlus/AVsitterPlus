# AVsitterPlus Release

`AVsitterPlus` is a fork of the `AVsitter` project. `AVsitter` has not been updated in many years, the last release was in March of 2018, and the last commit to the `AVsitter` repository was in 2021. `AVsitterPlus` incorporates all changes to `AVsitter` that have been committed since its last release and integrates several pull requests that have been reviewed but were never merged into `AVsitter`. In addition, `AVsitterPlus` adds several new features and bug fixes.

In order to comply with the `AVsitter` trademark restrictions, `AVsitterPlus` has not only been renamed but all `[AV]*` scripts, plugins, and utilities have been renamed. Renaming generally conforms to the pattern of replacement `[AV]` -> `AVP_`. For example, the `AVsitter` script `[AV]sitA` has been renamed to `AVP_sitA` in `AVsitterPlus`. These name changes make for a tedious task, not only for `AVsitterPlus` developers but for end users whose previously configured notecards may need significant changes. Trademark restrictions like this are, in my opinion, odious. However, the `AVsitter` team wanted to make it clear to the users whether they were using a legitimate release. I understand that view but there is also an approach that would have fostered greater collaboration and ease of use by all concerned.
